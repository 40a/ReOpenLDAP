ReOpenLDAP preamble
-------------------

We consider that the original OpenLDAP project was failed
due the following reasons:
 - disregard for support by community and code clarity.
 - giant technical debt and incredible low code quality.
 - unreasonable desire to support the wide range of
   an obsolete archaic systems and compilers.

Therefore, expects the following TODO list will never be done
or will never work properly.
