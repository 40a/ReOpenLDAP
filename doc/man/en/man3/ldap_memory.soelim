.SH NAME
ldap_memfree, ldap_memvfree, ldap_memalloc, ldap_memcalloc, ldap_memrealloc, ldap_strdup \- LDAP memory allocation routines
.SH LIBRARY
ReOpenLDAP LDAP (libreldap, \-lreldap)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <ldap.h>
.LP
.BI "void ldap_memfree(void *" p ");"
.LP
.BI "void ldap_memvfree(void **" v ");"
.LP
.BI "void *ldap_memalloc(ber_len_t " s ");"
.LP
.BI "void *ldap_memcalloc(ber_len_t " n ", ber_len_t " s ");"
.LP
.BI "void *ldap_memrealloc(void *" p ", ber_len_t " s ");"
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines are used to allocate/deallocate memory used/returned
by the LDAP library.
.BR ldap_memalloc (),
.BR ldap_memcalloc (),
.BR ldap_memrealloc (),
and
.BR ldap_memfree ()
are used exactly like the standard
.BR malloc (3),
.BR calloc (3),
.BR realloc (3),
and
.BR free (3)
routines, respectively.
The
.BR ldap_memvfree ()
routine is used to free a dynamically allocated array of pointers to
arbitrary dynamically allocated objects.
The
.BR ldap_strdup ()
routine is used exactly like the standard
.BR strdup (3)
routine.
