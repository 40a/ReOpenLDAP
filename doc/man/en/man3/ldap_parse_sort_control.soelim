.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <ldap.h>

.ft B
int ldap_parse_sort_control(ld, ctrls, returnCode, attribute)
.ft
LDAP *ld;
LDAPControl **ctrls;

char **attribute;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is used to parse the results returned in a search operation
that uses a server-side sort control.
.LP
It takes a null terminated array of LDAPControl structures usually obtained
by a call to the
.BR ldap_parse_result
function. A returncode which points to the sort control result code,and an array
of LDAPControl structures that list the client controls to use with the search.
The function also takes an out parameter \fIattribute\fP and if the sort operation
fails, the server may return a string that indicates the first attribute in the
sortKey list that caused the failure. If this parameter is NULL, no string is
returned. If a string is returned, the memory should be freed by calling the
ldap_memfree function.
