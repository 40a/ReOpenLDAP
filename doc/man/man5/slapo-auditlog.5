.SH NAME
slapo\-auditlog \- Audit Logging overlay to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.TP
ETCDIR/slapd.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a given
backend database to a specified log file. Changes are logged as standard
LDIF, with an additional comment header giving the timestamp of the change
and the identity of the user making the change.

For Add and Modify operations the identity comes from the modifiersName
associated with the operation. This is usually the same as the requestor's
identity, but may be set by other overlays to reflect other values.
