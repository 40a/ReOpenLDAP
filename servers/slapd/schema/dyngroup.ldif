# Dynamic Group schema (experimental), as defined by Netscape.  See
# http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/ent-server/pdf/esadmin611.pdf
# page 70 for details on how these groups were used.
#
# A description of the objectclass definition is available here:
# http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/schema/7.1/oc_dir.html#1303745
#
# depends upon:
#       core.schema
#
# These definitions are considered experimental due to the lack of
# a formal specification (e.g., RFC).
#
# NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE!  USE WITH CAUTION!
#
# The Netscape documentation describes this as an auxiliary objectclass
# but their implementations have always defined it as a structural class.
# The sloppiness here is because Netscape-derived servers don't actually
# implement the X.500 data model, and they don't honor the distinction
# between structural and auxiliary classes. This fact is noted here:
# http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5016864&messageID=9034636
#
# In accordance with other existing implementations, we define it as a
# structural class.
#
# Our definition of memberURL also does not match theirs but again
# their published definition and what works in practice do not agree.
# In other words, the Netscape definitions are broken and interoperability
# is not guaranteed.
#
# Also see the new DynGroup proposed spec at
# http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haripriya-dynamicgroup-02
