Making and Installing the ReOpenLDAP Distribution
===============================================

This file provides brief instructions on how to build and install
ReOpenLDAP on UNIX (and UNIX-like) systems.  More detailed information
and instructions can be found in The ReOpenLDAP Administrator's Guide
(available from http://pro-ldap.ru/).

It is recommended that you read, or at least skim through, ALL of the
instructions in this file before attempting to build the software.

It is also recommended you review the Frequently Asked Questions
(http://www.openldap.org/faq/) pages, in particular the Installation
section (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=8).

Making and Installing the ReOpenLDAP Distribution
-----------------------------------------------

1.   Unpack the distribution and change directory:

        % tar xfz reopenldap-VERSION.tgz
        % cd reopenldap-VERSION

     (replacing VERSION with the appropriate version string).  If you
     are reading this file, you probably have already done this!

2.   Type:

        % ./configure --help

     to list available configuration options.

     The configure script also looks for compiler/linker options on
     the command line and in the environment.  These include:

        Variable        Description     Example
        CC              C compiler      gcc
        CFLAGS          C flags         -O -g
        CPPFLAGS        cpp flags       -I/path/include -D__FOO__=42
        LDFLAGS         ld flags        -L/usr/local/lib
        LIBS            libraries       -llib
        PATH            command path    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

     See doc/install/configure for generic configure documentation.

3.   Configure the build system:

        % ./configure [options] [var=value ...]

     If all goes well, the configure script will automatically detect
     the appropriate settings.  If the configure script fails, you
     should read the config.log file that it generated to see what it
     was trying to do and exactly what failed.  You may need to
     specify additional options and/or variables besides those listed
     above to obtain desired results, depending on your operating
     system. The Platform Hints section of the FAQ provides help for
     operating system related problems.

4.   Build dependencies:

        % make depend

5.   Build the system:

        % make

     If all goes well, the system will build as configured.  If not,
     return to step 3 after reviewing the configuration settings.  You
     may want to consult the Platform Hints subsection of the FAQ if
     you have not done so already.

6.   Test the standalone system:

     This step requires the standalone LDAP server, slapd(8), with HDB
     and/or BDB support.

        % make test

     If all goes well, the system has been built as configured.  If
     not, return to step 2 after reviewing your configuration
     settings.  You may want to consult the Installation section of
     the FAQ if you have not done so already.

7.   Install the software.  You may need to become the super-user
     (e.g. root) to do this (depending on where you are installing
     things):

        % su root -c 'make install'

8.   That's it.  Enjoy!

See the ReOpenLDAP Administrator's Guide and the manual pages for the
individual applications for configuration and use information. You may
also want to edit the configuration files used by the various
components.  These configuration files are located in the ReOpenLDAP
configuration directory (normally /usr/local/etc/reopenldap).

        ldap.conf               client defaults
        slapd.conf              Standalone LDAP daemon
        schema/*.schema         Schema Definitions
