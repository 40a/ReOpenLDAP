This directory contains a slapd overlay, usn, that extends slapd
to maintain the usnCreated and usnChanged operational attributes
normally used by Microsoft ActiveDirectory.

To use the overlay, add:

	moduleload <path to>usn.so
	...

	database mdb
	...
	overlay usn

to your slapd configuration file. The schema definitions for the
two USN attributes are hardcoded in this overlay.

Use Makefile to compile this plugin or use a command line similar to:

	gcc -c -I ../../include/ -I ../../servers/slapd -DSLAPD_OVER_USN=SLAPD_MOD_DYNAMIC usn.c
	gcc -shared -o usn.so usn.o

This overlay is only set up to be built as a dynamically loaded module.
On most platforms, in order for the module to be usable, all of the
library dependencies must also be available as shared libraries.

If you need to build the overlay statically, you will have to move it into the
slapd/overlays directory and edit the Makefile and overlays.c to reference
it. You will also have to define SLAPD_OVER_USN to SLAPD_MOD_STATIC,
and add the relevant libraries to the main slapd link command.
