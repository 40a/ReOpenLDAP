This directory contains native slapd plugins that implement access rules.

gssacl.c contains a simple example that implements access control
based on GSS naming extensions attributes.

To use the acl-gssacl plugin, add:

moduleload contrib-gssacl.so

to your slapd configuration file.
It is configured using

access to <what>
        by dynacl/gss/<attribute>.[.{base,regex,expand}]=<valpat> {<level>|<priv(s)>}

The default is "exact"; in case of "expand", "<valpat>" results from
the expansion of submatches in the "<what>" portion.  "<level>|<priv(s)>"
describe the level of privilege this rule can assume.
