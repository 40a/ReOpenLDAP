This directory contains a native slapd plugin, dsaschema, that permits the
loading of DSA-specific schema from configuration files (including operational
attributes).

To use the plugin, add:

moduleload dsaschema.so
	/etc/reopenldap/schema/foo1.schema
	...etc...
	/etc/reopenldap/schema/fooN.schema

to your slapd configuration file.

Use Makefile to compile this plugin or use a command line similar to:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o dsaschema.so dsaschema.c
