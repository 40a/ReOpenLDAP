This directory contains native slapd plugins for password mechanisms that
are not actively supported by the project. Currently this includes the
Kerberos, Netscape MTA-MD5 and RADIUS password mechanisms. The Apache
APR1 MD5 and BSD/Paul Henning Kamp MD5 mechanisms are also included.

To use the Kerberos plugin, add:

moduleload contrib-pw-kerberos.la

to your slapd configuration file.

To use the Netscape plugin, add:

moduleload contrib-pw-netscape.la

to your slapd configuration file.

To use the APR1/BSD/MD5 plugin, add:

moduleload contrib-pw-apr1.la

to your slapd configuration file.

To use the RADIUS plugin, add:

moduleload contrib-pw-radius.la

to your slapd configuration file; optionally, the path to a configuration
file can be appended in the form

moduleload pw-radius.la config="/etc/radius.conf"

Use Makefile to compile this plugin or use a command line similar to:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -DHAVE_KRB5 -o pw-kerberos.so kerberos.c

Replace HAVE_KRB5 with HAVE_KRB4 if you want to use Kerberos IV.
If your Kerberos header files are not in the C compiler's
default path, you will need to add a "-I" directive for that as well.

The corresponding command for the Netscape plugin would be:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o pw-netscape.so netscape.c

The corresponding command for the RADIUS plugin would be:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o pw-radius.so radius.c -lradius

(Actually, you might want to statically link the RADIUS client library
libradius.a into the module).

The corresponding command for the APR1 plugin would be:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o pw-apr1.so apr1.c
