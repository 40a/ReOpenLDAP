.SH NAME
slapo-allop \- All Operational Attributes overlay
.SH SYNOPSIS
@SYSCONFDIR@/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The All Operational Attributes overlay is designed to allow slapd to
interoperate with dumb clients that expect all attributes, including
operational ones, to be returned when "*" or an empty attribute list
is requested, as opposed to RFC2251 and RFC3673.
.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the All Operational overlay.
They should appear after the
.B overlay
directive and before any subsequent
.B database
directive.
.TP
.B allop-URI <ldapURI>
Specify the base and the scope of search operations that trigger the overlay.
By default, it is "ldap:///??base", i.e. it only applies to the rootDSE.
This requires the overlay to be instantited as global.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
default behavior: only affects requests to the rootDSE
.nf
        # global
        overlay         allop
.fi
.LP
affects all requests
.nf
        # global
        overlay         allop
        allop-URI       "ldap:///??sub"
.fi
.LP
affects only requests directed to the suffix of a database
.nf
        # per database
        database        bdb
        suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
        # database specific directives ...
        overlay         allop
        allop-URI       "ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??base"
.fi
